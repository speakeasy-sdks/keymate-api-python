    r"""Here's a breakdown of the internetSearch (/Keymate.AI Search) plugin's operations and their typical use-cases:

    How to use parameters to fine tune the search?
    q is always the search keywords you can always prompt ChatGPT to use different keywords or specific keywords.
    numofpages and percentile . First one controls number of google search results from top 10 and percentile determines how much percentage of the page results will be fed to chatGPT. Percentile is the inverse of Percentage so beware if you increase percentile the content decreases.
    numofpages: If you prompt chatgpt numofpages to be set between 1-10 it determines how many first results of Google Search links will be provided to the ChatGPT
    percentile: If you prompt chatgpt percentile to be set between 1-100 it determines how large or small would be the content passed to the ChatGPT. The higher the value is the lesser content will be passed to ChatGPT. Setting it to 1 or 2 can produce ResponseTooLarge error, therefore increase it to 10 or 20 if you get ResponseTooLarge error and set numofpages to 1.<

    1. searchAndBrowse
    What it does: Searches the internet using a query and returns some content from these pages.
